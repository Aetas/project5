Project 5 on Binary search trees

Assignment 5 for CU Boulder, CSCI 2270 Algorithms and Data Structures.
Create a binary search tree around a list of movies (comma delim) that sorts and interacts with the user's inputs as if it were a vendor. Writeup (that looks rather sparse as of 2-21-15) provided by course.
Since this is graded by COG auto grader, there are seemingly a few copies of source files and conflicting makefiles floating about the directories, but that is to distinguish from the work I would like to do, and the work that I have to do to make an insipid auto grader happy.
